### Description of the project:

Ambers Magical Weather App is not so magical. By utilizing the OpenWeather One Call API, it retrieves weather data for cities. By typing a city name into the search field and then clicking search, the dashboard will display the current weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. WHEN I click on a city in the search history
